a simple bash script that converts any images found in a specified source directory, 
converts them to avif and moves them into a different specified folder. 
it does the same for any video files and converts them to av1. 
Even retains metadata!!

Make sure you have imagemagick installed for image conversion.
As for the video decoder, I used libaom-av1
